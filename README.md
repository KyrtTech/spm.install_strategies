#  Service Package Manager - Install Strategies

Different install strategies scripts are gathered under this project.

This is both an example on how to store and distribute `install strategies` scripts and also the initial test bed for it.

If you want to read more about `install strategies` head over to the knowledge repo where this is defined. The repo is located [here](https://github.com/KyrtTech/spm.knowledge_domain).

## Structure

Each folder represents an `install strategy`.

Under each folder the are the files needed to be executed so the strategy works.

The goal would be to have a mix o scripts ranging from `shell` scripts to `js`, `python`, `ruby` or anything else that works.

## How does this work

`Install strategies` are defined under the [knowledge project](https://github.com/KyrtTech/spm.knowledge_domain) and available at the repository level (TBD). So head over there to see the link between a strategy and this repo.

> This repo is just used as an example of storage.
